Ruby on Rails is an open source web application framework written in the Ruby programming language, following the paradigm of the Model Vista Controller model.

The ruby ​​on rails page mentions that installing rails is as easy as putting 'gem install rails' in the console, but we must bear in mind that we use the ruby ​​language and a rubygems library manager.
